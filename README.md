## Hi, I'm Alya 👋

Computer Science student focused on building real, simple, and user-friendly web experiences.  
Right now I'm deep into front-end fundamentals — learning by building, breaking, and fixing things myself.

I care about clean UI, clear logic, and making things feel good to use — not just “work.”

---

### 🌱 What I'm Working On
- Strengthening HTML, CSS & JavaScript
- Building small UI projects and real layouts
- Understanding component-based design + reusable code

---

### 🎯 My Current Direction
- Front-End Development (priority)
- UX Principles & clean design
- Eventually: modern stacks → React & Tailwind

---

### 🧠 Background (short & real)
- CS foundation (Java, Python, data structures)
- Built academic systems (like a hotel management system)
- Networking & embedded basics from uni projects
- Comfortable learning fast & figuring things out solo

Not claiming senior dev energy — just building my skills step-by-step.
